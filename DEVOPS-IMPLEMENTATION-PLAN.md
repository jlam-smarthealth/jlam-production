## ðŸ“‹ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current State Assessment:
- **Infrastructure**: Basic Docker Compose on single Scaleway instance
- **Deployment**: Manual SSH-based deployments (CRITICAL RISK)
- **Monitoring**: None implemented
- **Backups**: No automated strategy
- **Security**: Basic SSL, no secrets management
- **Compliance**: No GDPR/healthcare compliance measures
- **State Management**: Local Terraform state (RISK)

### Target State:
- **Infrastructure**: Immutable, declarative IaC with Terraform Cloud
- **Deployment**: Fully automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager stack
- **Backups**: Automated daily backups with 30-day retention
- **Security**: HashiCorp Vault, encrypted secrets, zero-trust networking
- **Compliance**: GDPR-compliant, audit logging, data encryption

## ðŸ”§ PHASE 1: FOUNDATION IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. TERRAFORM STATE MANAGEMENT (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Local state files risk corruption and contain secrets

**Solution**: Migrate to Terraform Cloud immediately

**Implementation Steps**:
```bash
1. Create Terraform Cloud organization "jlam"
2. Configure remote backend in terraform/backends.tf
3. Migrate existing state: terraform init -migrate-state
4. Configure workspace variables (sensitive)
5. Test deployment via Terraform Cloud
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Zero local .tfstate files
- All deployments tracked in audit log
- State locking prevents conflicts
- Automated backup every change

### 2. SECRETS MANAGEMENT (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Secrets in .env files, no rotation, no audit trail

**Solution**: Implement proper secrets management

**Implementation**:
```yaml
Immediate:
- GitHub Secrets for CI/CD variables
- Terraform Cloud for infrastructure secrets
- .env.example with dummy values
- Automated secret scanning

Future (Phase 3):
- HashiCorp Vault deployment
- Dynamic secret rotation
- Certificate management
- API key management
```

### 3. GITHUB ACTIONS CI/CD (Priority: HIGH)

**Problem**: Manual deployments via SSH scripts (dangerous!)

**Solution**: Fully automated CI/CD pipeline

**Pipeline Stages**:
```yaml
1. Code Quality:
   - Linting (ESLint, shellcheck)
   - Security scanning (Trivy, Snyk)
   - Unit tests
   
2. Build & Test:
   - Docker build
   - Integration tests
   - Smoke tests
   
3. Infrastructure:
   - Terraform plan (staging)
   - Manual approval gate
   - Terraform apply
   
4. Deployment:
   - Blue-green deployment
   - Health checks
   - Automatic rollback
   
5. Post-deployment:
   - Smoke tests
   - Performance tests
   - Security scan
```

### 4. AUTOMATED BACKUPS (Priority: HIGH)

**Problem**: No automated backups, single point of failure

**Solution**: Multi-tier backup strategy

**Implementation**:
```yaml
Database Backups:
- Daily automated PostgreSQL dumps
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Cross-region replication
- 30-day retention policy

Application Backups:
- Docker volume snapshots
- Configuration backups to S3
- SSL certificate backups
- Encrypted off-site storage

Recovery Testing:
- Weekly recovery drills
- RTO: 1 hour
- RPO: 24 hours
- Documented runbooks
```

- Business: User signups, Active users
- Security: Failed logins, Suspicious activity

Dashboards:

- Cost Analysis
```

### Alert Strategy:
```yaml
P1 (Wake up):
- Site down > 1 minute
- Database unreachable
- Security breach detected
- Data loss event

P2 (Business hours):
- Response time > 2s
- Error rate > 1%
- Disk usage > 80%
- Certificate expiry < 7 days

P3 (Daily check):
- Cost anomaly
- Backup failure
- Update available
```
